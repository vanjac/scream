# scream
scream is a text editor for screaming your thoughts into the void.

Features:
- Write things and they will appear on the screen, and also in a file
- Every change is saved to the file immediately
- Press backspace to make characters disappear, sometimes. (you can't delete lines sorry)
- Multi-platform: it works on at least 2 platforms
- Emoji support: if you type emojis it won't break the whole program, for the most part (unless you're on windows sorry)

To use:
Run `python3 scream.py a_file_name` to edit a file. You can add text to the end, and delete characters on the current line, and that's it. Press Ctrl-q or Ctrl-c to quit (at least one of those will work, depending on the platform).
